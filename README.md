# MH19ReddTunfisken

## What is this?
We are Redd Tunfisken, a competitor in KnowIt's Milj√∏ Hackathon 2019. This is our project.

## The pitch
We're making an app (web/mobile) that lets people create an account to track their waste generation and disposal. Subscribers will be able to track, compare and learn about their waste generation, disposal and recycling. There will be badges, scores and incentives to learn and improve how we handle household waste. The app wil also have a kids version which helps teach the new generation and involve the entire family in a project that not only benefits themselves, but also the globe.
